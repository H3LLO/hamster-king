# General design
Hex based city builder

Constant waves, short breaks.

No in game pause for building

Sparse map resource generation

Screen area grows with your level (?)
-Start with large area
-Grows by two cells (one each side) every 10 levels

Tile synergies

Several resource types, generated by towers

Anything placed on the map should be a tower

Leveling up adds global tower upgrades that are accessible on a per tower basis
